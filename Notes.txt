What is Apache kafka ?

The Apache kafka is distributed streaming platform.

Kafka Features 

1.Scalability: Kafka can handle a high volume of data with low latency. 
It is designed to be horizontally scalable, 
so you can add more brokers to the cluster as the data volume increases.

2.Durability: Kafka stores all published records for a configurable amount of time, 
providing durability in the event of system failures.

3.Fault tolerance: Kafka is designed to be highly available and
can tolerate broker failures without losing data.

4.High throughput: Kafka can process millions of records per second,
making it suitable for high-throughput applications.

5.Publish-subscribe model: Kafka uses a publish-subscribe model for messaging, 
where producers write data to Kafka topics and consumers read from those topics.

6.Low latency: Kafka has low latency, allowing for real-time processing of data streams. 
(amount of time required to process each message).

7.Support for multiple languages: Kafka has client libraries for multiple programming languages, 
including Java, Python, and C++.

8.Integration with other systems: Kafka can be easily integrated with other systems, 
such as Hadoop, Spark, and Elasticsearch, using connectors.
